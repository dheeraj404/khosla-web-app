                            <li>Founders and Managing Directors of the company <b> MR. MANOJ KHOSLA & MR. MANISH KHOSLA.</b></li>
                            <li>First showroom opened in April 1987, it is in Hazra, opposite to Basushree Cinema. It is just 225sqft showroom and we call it our mother showroom and is still the most valued and precious showroom to us. Further, we have many customers from that showroom, whose 2nd generation is now coming with their kids to buy products from here. Employees who had started their first job with us from very beginning are still working with us & have reached a higher position in Khosla Electronics Private Limited. </li>
                            <li>It has been a long journey since we have started our business and at that point of time we just kept one thing in our mind which were taught by our parents – that we should be very true to our customers. We are from a very humble Family and our Father was a CA – qualified (which was very rarely found in those days) and Mother was home maker. Our parents had a vision that we should be self employed and have to help in job creation for others who are like us and to inspire them to do something in life.</li>
                            <li>We opened our 2nd showroom in 1997 and after giving 10 years of day and night hard work to our business in Ballygunge, Park Circus (next to quest mall today), today it has become a landmark in that area and a pillar of Khosla Electronics Private Limited.</li>
                            <li>After this there was no stopping. Its 2020 and we have got fifty Showrooms.</li>
                            <li>Now we are spreading our wings in West Bengal, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana.</li>

<h1>What we really do?</h1>
</div>
<p className='whatwedo'>
Our usp has been that we have retained our customers and our employees both. We have employees who are still working with us from 1987. Most of the employees who were with us in our growing days are still associated with us and treat our office like their home and due to this dedication from them and our continuous support in every way possible to them and their families we were able to create this position for our business. It is very much true that no business can grow alone, Employers brains / innovation and honesty towards the profession along with employees dedication and endless nights & days of hard work makes a 1st generation business stand the way it is today.
